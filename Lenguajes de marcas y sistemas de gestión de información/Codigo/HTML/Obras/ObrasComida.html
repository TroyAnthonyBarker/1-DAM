                <p>This is delicious. Doubled the sauce part for same amount of chicken in the recipe and used boneless
                    thighs. Worried breasts would come out tough. Everyone gobbled it up. And so easy. Definitely a
                    keeper.</p>

                <p>I had the chicken wanting something different however my husband does not like soy sauce so I
                    substituted it for brown sugar now it was a little sweet however it tasted so great. Thank you for
                    this wonderful recipe I now have it at it to my recipe book and it will become a dinner fixture in
                    my kitchen</p>

                <p>Most commercially raised raised chicken breasts are up to 1.5″ thick! If you leave them that
                    thickness, they will burn before the inside gets cooked. Not good eats…</p>

                <p>You’ve done it again! Absolutely delicious, and I’m not ashamed to say I used my finger to get every
                    bit of sauce off my plate!</p>

                <p>Was SO good. Hubby wants it again soon! I doubled the recipe for 5 pieces & used cilantro instead of
                    parsley. Yum</p>

                <p>Found this recipe a few weeks ago and have made it 4 times. So juicy, tender and flavorful. My
                    husband doesn’t like breaded chicken and there are few recipes for skinless and boneless chicken
                    that retain the moisture. This is sooo good!</p>

                <p>If adding brown sugar would you add it when you are pan frying the chicken with seasonings AND adding
                    it to the spice & butter mixture? Or just to the butter & spice mixture? Thanks!</p>

                <p>I accidentally found this recipe one day about 2 years ago. This is by far one of the most tastiest
                    chicken I’ve ever tasted in my life. My children and husband love it too. I’ve introduced this
                    recipe to several friends as well and they loved it. It’s a favourite in our home now. Thank you!!!
