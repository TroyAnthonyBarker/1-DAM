                    <h2>Beef Wellington</h2>
                    <p>It was hasimply divine! We had made reservations for last Friday nite and what a nite it turned
                        out to be.
                        We opted to dine from the Tasting Menu and loved every course. We also had the pleasure of
                        chatting with
                        HK 10 winner Christina. What an amazing person. She signed our menus and took some pics with us
                        which topped off the evening.
                        The whole experience was just awesome, so if you have the chance to go, make reservations and
                        enjoy yourselves.
                        We were there to celebrate our 25th anniversary and it was for both of us, the best meal of our
                        lives!

                    <h2>Gordon Ramsay Burger</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gordon Ramsay Burger is a great place to go for delicious and flavorful burgers and much more.
                        I really like the location and everything that they have available here. The staff here is very
                        friendly and
                        accommodating to make sure that you have everything that you need
                    </p>

                    <h2>Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
                    <p>We had a pepperoni pizza, spaghetti bolognese and penne arrabiatta and it was delicious. It’s
                        definitely worth a visit.</p>

                <div class="resena">
                    <h2>Sticky Toffee</h2>
                    <p>
                        We had a great dinner at GR Steak. Yes, the pieces are high, but you're in Vegas, what do you
                        expect?
                        We had the Beef Wellington. It was so tender that teeth are not needed to eat it.
                        The short ribs melted in your mouth. The best part was dessert, and the reason for our
                        return trip to his restaurant... The stick toffee pudding. Hands down, the best dessert on the
                        planet!!!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Apple Crumble</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pricey for sure, but worth a try! The Fish and chips were perfectly battered! The mushy mint
                        peas was
                        interesting - definitely up to one's taste preference. But the Apple Crisp dessert topped with
                        ice cream.....
                        HEAVENLY!
